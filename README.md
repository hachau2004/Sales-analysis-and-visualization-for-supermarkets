**MY PROJECT**

This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and sales performance using Tableau to uncover meaningful business insights. By transforming raw data into interactive dashboards and visual stories, the goal is to provide clear, actionable recommendations that can drive improvements in marketing, sales, and customer retention strategies.

Through deep data exploration, this project aims to support strategic decision-making at multiple levels from optimizing product mix and pricing to identifying high-value customer segments and regional performance trends. The analysis is designed to highlight hidden patterns, address key business challenges, and help the company make informed, data-driven decisions in a competitive market.
